# Suppose you are given a data frame where all but one of the variables are
# numeric. The final variable (though not necessarily final in position) is a
# factor associated with different levels of your observations. Implement the
# function "meanByLevel" that returns the mean value for each of the numeric
# variables by the levels given from the factor variable. Your function should
# take the following arguments:
#
# <data>: a data frame where all but one of the variables are numeric. The final
#   variable is a factor giving the different levels of the observations. **The
#   factor variable is not necessarily the final variable in position.**
#
# Your function should return:
#
# <level.means>: the means of each of the variables broken down by each of the
#   levels (this should be a num.factors x num.numeric.variables matrix).

# Suppose you are given a data frame with the same structure as in the previous
# part of the question. You are interested in identifying the difference between
# the overall average for a given variable and the factor level average for that
# variable. You want this difference to be standardized by the overall standard
# deviation for that variable. Implement the function "stdLevelDiff" that does
# this for each of the numeric variables in your data frame. Your function
# should take the following arguments:
#
# <data>: a data frame where all but one of the variables are numeric. The final
#   variable is a factor giving the different levels of the observations. **The
#   factor variable is not necessarily the final variable in position**
#
# Your function should return: 
#
# <level.diff> the difference between mean by factor level and overal
#   mean for each variable divided by the overall standard deviation for each
#   variable. This should be a num.factors x num.numeric.variables matrix.
#   NOTE: you may need to use R's transpose function to make sure that the
#   dimensions of your return value are correct.
